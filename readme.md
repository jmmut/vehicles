# Vehicles

Simple simulation of [Braitenberg Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle)

So far this simulates vehicles 2a and 2b. Vehicles of level 3 or more are trickier and tricker to implement, but hopefully some day I'll implement some of them.

## Running this project

Clone this repo, then [Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then do `cargo run --release`.
